# Kickstarter-analysis
# Overview 
This purpose of this project was to give a quick anaylsis on successful kickstarter funds. This analysis will give insight on the most successful kickstarters by catagory and by time of year,and dollar amount. This will allow the kickstarter managers insight on when to lauch. 
# Analysis and Challenges 
The analysis performed on the data set was outcomes by time of launch date and percent funded vs goal 
## Outcomes by launch date

The image above is a simple line graph that counts the number of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters by launch date. There is a peak of successful kickerstarters that launch in May. Maybe everyone is getting excited for summer and wants to spend some money
## Outcomes based on Goals 
![Outcomes based on Goals](https://github.com/mccoycory/Kickstarter/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes%20based%20on%20goal.png)
The image above shows the percent of successful outcomes vs the goal dollar amount. The most successful kickerstarters have a target goal of less than 1000 dollars.
## Challenges 
The most challenging part of this data set was using the count if on the raw data page. I did not know that enough though you have filtered the data for a visual view, if you count all columns, it will contain the whole data set. This was fixed by using the countif formula and using "plays" as a critera. 
#Results 
Based on the two results found from the graphs. The kickstarter manager should launch the kickstarter in May and have a target goal of less than 1000 dollars. The main limitation of the data set is its age. 2017 is the most recent year and there have been many changes to life since then like a pandemic... Most recent data would be helpful. There also is no age demographic on who is donating money and how they are donating (online, check, events, etc.) It would be nice to have a target market.
